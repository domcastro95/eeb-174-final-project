1. I am interested in the extinction on the fossil mammal of Strigiformes (owls).
2. I plan to use the occurances from the PBDP to reconstruct fossil ranges. I will be using fossile age and locality data to form my results of the different fossils recorded in my .csv file.
This will help me visualize the results of the fossils in a more quantitative manner for students and civilians alike.
